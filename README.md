# ðŸŒ€ Coil

This is a visual timer app, like a [pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). Open it on your phone, save it to your home screen, et voila! Drag clockwise to wind it up, tap to start or pause it.

[Start using Coil](https://z0u.github.io/coil-timer)

Features:

- **Distraction-free:** Subtle visual changes and silent while running
- **Stays on:** Your screen won't automatically close while the timer is running and focused
- **Screen protection:** The display changes subtly to prevent pixels from remaining lit for too long[^protection]
- **Battery-saving:** Dark mode with a pitch-black background to take advantage of OLED screens
- **Persistent sessions:** Remembers the end time that you set, even if you close the app â€” simply re-open it to resume
- **Nothing to install:** Coil is a progressive web app (PWA) â€” just [open the web page](https://z0u.github.io/coil-timer) to use it. You can optionally install it by saving it to your home screen.

Controls:

- **Start/stop:** Tap the clock face
- **Adjust duration:** Swipe to turn the clock face like a dial
- **Fullscreen:** Press the fullscreen button, or double-tap outside the clock face
- **Show/hide controls:** Tap on the edges of the screen
